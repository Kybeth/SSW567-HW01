# Description of my experience with HW01

- When writing the program, there are two main challenges:
    - How to design the classifications: the main reason for this is that categories have overlaps. 
    - How to design enough tests.
- The requirements specification is not a good one, because it did not consider the overlap I mentioned above.
- I used unittest before so I didn't encounter challenges with it.
- The criteria I used to determine that I had sufficient test cases are:
    - I test every condition the requirement says
    - I test invalid input
    - I test some conditions that I think of is easy to be wrong
